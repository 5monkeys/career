## About the Job

Come join us building advanced frontends for some of Swedens largest digital
service providers and e-commerce sites. We like working with a modern set of
development tools, focusing on building blocks and processes that helps us
deliver high quality products.

We use Github to collaborate on projects and aim to always have a high test
coverage and well written code. Before any piece of code is deployed in
production it will usually have to pass peer review and Continous Integration.

us at jobb@5monkeys.se.*

From our offices in Gothenburg (near Götaplatsen) and Stockholm (Slussen) we
build large scale digital services for our clients. Keeping all development
in-house enables us to keep delivering with high levels of quality as well as
deep technical knowledge. It also let's us learn from each other.

We actively contribute to multiple Open Source projects and encourage all our
employees to do the same. Open Source Software is an integral part of our
culture and a large factor in our ability to deliver business value to our
clients. You will find some of our projects [on GitHub][gh-org].

For more than a decade we have been helping startups and enterprises alike
realizing their ideas by utilizing a mix of digital strategy, software
development and Open Source Software.

## Who are we looking for?

You share our love for JavaScript, and have a deep knowledge of its strengths
and pitfalls. You have probably worked with a Component Based Framework (such
as React, Vue or Svelte) and you have written statically typed JavaScript (for
example with Flow or TypeScript). You have experience with setting up developer
environments with tools like Webpack, Gulp or Yarn. If you don't tick all these
boxes, don't hesitate to reach out anyway, we will always appreciate curiousity
and the ability to learn. 

Some other technologies you would probably be working with on 5 Monkeys:

- GraphQL
- Babel
- SCSS
- Autoprefixer
