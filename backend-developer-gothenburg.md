## About the Job

Come join us building advanced systems for some of Swedens largest digital

From our offices in Gothenburg (near Götaplatsen) and Stockholm (Slussen) we
build large scale digital services for our clients. Keeping all development
in-house enables us to keep delivering with high levels of quality as well as
deep technical knowledge. It also let's us learn from each other.

We actively contribute to multiple Open Source projects and encourage all our
employees to do the same. Open Source Software is an integral part of our
culture and a large factor in our ability to deliver business value to our
clients. You will find some of our projects [on GitHub][gh-org].

For more than a decade we have been helping startups and enterprises alike
realizing their ideas by utilizing a mix of digital strategy, software
development and Open Source Software.

Today we are roughly 20 employees and we just recently opened the Gothenburg
office. While we are hiring in Stockholm as well our current focus is growing
the Gothenburg office. We love open software and we are particularly fond of
Python, Django, Linux and Docker.

## Who are we looking for?

You share our passion for Python and building performant and predictable
backend systems. You don't hesitate to dive in and solve problems throughout
the stack. Just like us you take pride in writing neat, self-documenting code.

Learning is something you do everyday and you value this by sharing your
knowledge with the team and staying up to date with the latest tech.

We think you are a great teamplayer and that you can work together with our
team and with our clients to build great products.
